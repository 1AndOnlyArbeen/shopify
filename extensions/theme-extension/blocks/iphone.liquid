  shoopify Buy iphone get free charger

     when the user add  the iphone in the cart , add the Charger in the cart auto ,
     when the user remove the iphone from the cart , remove the Charger from the cart auto ,
     when the user change the quantity of the iphone in the cart , change the quantity of the Charger in the cart auto
     when the user remove the charger while the iphone is in the cart , auto re-add the charger in the cart,


     logic to build it
  1. i have to see the cart if the iphone is in the cart or not if yes then add the charger in the cart.
  2. if the user remove the iphone from the cart then remove the charger from the cart
  3. if the user change the quantity of the iphone in the cart then change the quantity of the charger in the cart
  4. if the user remove the charger while the iphone is in the cart then auto re-add the charger in the cart,for this i have to use the cart ajax api to add , remove and change the quantity of the charger in the cart, but to remember is that i dont need to refresh the whole page it should do auto refresh.
